This is an alpha version of Template::TT2.  This will become the 
replacement for the v2 Template Toolkit modules for the purpose 
of backwards compatibility when TT3 is released.

If you currently have code using TT2 like this:

    use Template;

    my $tt2 = Template->new(
        INCLUDE_PATH => '/path/to/templates',
    );

Then, when TT3 is released, you will need to install Template::TT2 and 
change it to:

    use Template::TT2;

    my $tt2 = Template::TT2->new(
        INCLUDE_PATH => '/path/to/templates',
    );

Everything that is currently in the v2 Template::* namespace has been
moved "down" a level into the Template::TT2::* namespace.  All of the code
has been cleaned up and refactored to use the Badger toolkit.  This 
implements all the generic functionality (i.e. not directly related to 
template processing) that is shared between TT2, TT3, and any other 
modules or applications that might use it.

There are a few architectural changes that may affect any code that pokes
deep into the internals of TT2.  Most notable is the Template::Provider 
module that has been split into 3 new modules: Template::TT2::Templates, 
Template::TT2::Cache and Template::TT2::Store.  Any code that is relying
on the Old World Order in that regard will, I'm afraid, have to be 
re-written or modified to accomodate these changes.  

However, the vast majority of code that relies only on TT2's external 
features should require no more than a change in the module name. 
Although the code has been cleaned up as best as possible, it is at
heart the same old code that provides a faithful implementation of
TT2, warts and all.  

Template::TT2 was forked from the main Template repository in October 2008 
and completed (to the point of implementing all of TT2's features) by the 
end of December 2008.  Since then it has fallen a little being the 
current state of the repository.  There are perhaps a few dozen small 
patches that need to be back-ported onto Template::TT2 to bring it up to 
date.  There are also a handful of tests that are failing.  This could be 
due to some of the recent changes in Badger.  I think they're mostly
trivial things, but I haven't had a chance to look through them yet.

If anyone would like to help bring Template::TT2 up to date and get it
ready for release then please get in touch.  TT3 can't be released until 
Template::TT2 is also ready for action so it's a vitally important job,
even if it's not the most glamorous or funnest one.

Otherwise you'll have to wait for me to do it, and you never know how long 
that might take...
