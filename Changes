* Template::TT2::Exception expects named parameters to the constructor
  rather than the more limited ($type, $info) position args of v2
  Template::Exception.  as_string() is now text(), select_handler() is
  now match_type()
  
* No ABSOLUTE option.  Put '/' in your INCLUDE_PATH (or should I do it for 
  you if ABSOLUTE is set?)
  
* No RELATIVE option.  Put '.' in your INCLUDE_PATH (ditto).

* No DELIMITER option.  Use a list ref.

* No PRE_DEFINE option.  Use VARIABLES.

* Added Template::TT2::Cache.  It uses the same get()/set() API as 
  Cache::Cache so you can use any of the Cache::Cache::* modules as a 
  drop-in replacement for it.

* Added CACHE option

* DEBUG_PROVIDER is now DEBUG_TEMPLATES

* In some places, DEBUG_XXXX options don't work.  Need to set DEBUG instead.

* V1DOLLAR is no more

TODO:
 * remove magical 'import' from Stash, implement in context if necessary
 * change stash getref() to get_ref(), get_later() or something like that
 * add expose_objects option to stash
 * fix DEBUG options
 * stop aliasing error to 'e'
