* All methods now throw exceptions on error.  

* Template::Provider has been renamed Template::TT2::Templates. In-memory
  caching functionality has been moved into Template::TT2::Cache which is
  sufficiently API compatible with Cache::Cache to allow any Cache::Cache
  module to be used as a drop-in replacement. On-disk persistent storage of
  compiled templates is now managed by Template::TT2::Store

* Template::TT2::Exception expects named parameters to the constructor
  rather than the more limited ($type, $info) position args of v2
  Template::Exception.  as_string() is now text(), select_handler() is
  now match_type()

* parser errors are now reported as parse errors instead of file errors
  with a parse error in the info field.
  
* ABSOLUTE option is deprecated.  Put '/' in your INCLUDE_PATH instead, 
  or leave INCLUDE_PATH undefined.  You can still use ABSOLUTE (and 
  we'll put '/' in your INCLUDE_PATH), but you'll get an annoying 
  warning.
  
* No RELATIVE option.  Put '.' in your INCLUDE_PATH.  As per ABSOLUTE,
  you can still use it but you'll get a WARNING.

* No more DELIMITER option for specifying multiple INCLUDE_PATH 
  directories using a delimiter other than ':' .  Use a list ref for
  multiple INCLUDE_PATH directories.

* No PRE_DEFINE option any more.  Use VARIABLES.

* Added Template::TT2::Cache.  It uses the same get()/set() API as 
  Cache::Cache so you can use any of the Cache::Cache::* modules as a 
  drop-in replacement for it.

* DEBUG_PROVIDER is now DEBUG_TEMPLATES

* In some places, DEBUG_XXXX options don't work.  Need to set DEBUG instead.

* V1DOLLAR is no more

* Changed Math plugin to also define virtual methods.  Also removed 
  Math::TrulyRandom.  I have no idea what it was doing there, but I can't 
  imagine it has any practical value for the average TT user.  

* Moved Template::Plugin::Autoformat into a separate CPAN module.
  
TODO (mostly things that cropped up that need to be done for TT3):

 * remove magical 'import' from Stash, implement in context if necessary
 * change stash getref() to get_ref(), get_later() or something like that
 * add expose_objects option to stash
 * fix DEBUG options
 * stop aliasing error to 'e'
 * stop dumping compiled templates in '/' !!!
 * updated t/language/tied.t for XS stash
